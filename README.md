# Quick Start

The Ship does not include any copyrighted assets. You are required to provide a supported copy of the game.

### 1. Verify your ROM dump
You can verify you have dumped a supported copy of the game by using the compatibility checker at https://ship.equipment/. If you'd prefer to manually validate your ROM dump, you can cross-reference its `sha1` hash with the hashes [here](docs/supportedHashes.json).

### 2. Install the APK
Download and install the APK from the [Releases](https://github.com/linkzenic/Shipwright-Android/releases) page.

### 3. Set up the game

1. Open the app and allow all file permissions. It will ask to set up files, let it finish.

2. When prompted, select "Yes" to generate an OTR and "Yes" to look for a ROM. Navigate to your ROM and select it. Extraction will begin.

3. When asked whether to extract another ROM, select "Yes" if you have a Master Quest ROM or "No" to start the game.

4. On subsequent launches the game starts directly. To get the ROM selection dialog back, delete the `.otr` files in the `SOH` folder at the root of your device storage.

Use the *Back/Select/-* button on your controller to open the **Enhancements menu**. Use touch controls or a controller to navigate menus.

### 4. Play!

Congratulations, you are now sailing with the Ship of Harkinian! Have fun!

# FAQ

**Q: How do I add mods?**

A: Place mod `.otr` and `.o2r` files in the `SOH` folder at the root of your device storage. Then enable them in the Enhancements menu under Mods.

**Q: The game crashes immediately on launch.**

A: Delete the `SOH` folder and let the app set up its files again. Be patient during black screens; extraction can take a minute.

**Q: The game opened once but now shows a black screen.**

A: Delete `imgui.ini` from your `SOH` folder. Also ensure MSAA is set to 1 in the graphics settings, as higher values cause a black screen on many devices.

**Q: My controller's menu button isn't opening the Enhancements menu.**

A: This is a known first-launch issue caused by Android's input device registration. Close and reopen the app; the controller will work correctly on the second launch.

**Q: D-pad doesn't navigate the menu on first launch.**

A: Same cause as above. Close and reopen the app after the initial ROM extraction completes.

**Q: Touch overlay buttons aren't remappable in the controls editor.**

A: Open the controls editor (Enhancements menu) and look for the "Touch Controls" section under the Link tab. Touch overlay buttons appear as "Touch Overlay" in the device list and can be remapped there.

**Q: Rumble doesn't work with my Bluetooth controller.**

A: External Bluetooth controller rumble is not currently supported. Rumble works via device vibration on handheld devices (e.g. Retroid Pocket). A fix for Bluetooth controller rumble is planned.

# Known Bugs

- External Bluetooth controller rumble is not supported. Device vibration is used as a fallback.
- Touch overlay and physical controller button mappings share the same slot per port, so you cannot assign different actions to the same button on each.

# Build

### Build Tools

- [Ubuntu Noble Numbat | 24.04.2 LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/noble/)
- [CMake 3.31.5](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases)
- [OpenJDK 17](https://jdk.java.net/archive/)
- Android SDK 31
- Android NDK 26.0.10792818
- Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) 8.10.1
- Gradle 8.11.1

### Build Instructions

Building requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (or any OCI-compatible tool such as Podman) on a Linux environment. Windows users should use WSL2 and clone the repository to a native Linux path (e.g. `~/Shipwright`) rather than a Windows-mounted path (e.g. `/mnt/c/...`), as NTFS mounts can cause build issues.

1. Clone the repository and submodules:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/linkzenic/Shipwright-Android.git
    cd Shipwright-Android
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

2. Pull the build container:

    ```bash
    cd docker
    make setup
    ```

    If you prefer not to use the published image, you can build it locally from the included `Containerfile` instead:

    ```bash
    cd docker
    make create_container
    ```

3. Build the APK:

    ```bash
    make build_release
    ```

The resulting APK will be at `Android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/`.

`make setup` only needs to be run once. On subsequent builds, `make build_release` is all that's needed.
